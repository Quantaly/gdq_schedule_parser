# gdq_schedule_parser

Generates an iCalendar file from https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule.

During GDQ events, I try to periodically update https://quantaly.github.io/gdq_schedule_parser/out.ics with the output from this program. I make no guarantees as to its accuracy or relevancy at any given moment.
